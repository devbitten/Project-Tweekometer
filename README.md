## What is this?
This is an Android app that let's a user monitor their body's current caffeine concentration. It let's one input how much caffeine they have consumed, based on the products listed (e.g. Red Bull, Coke etc.). It also shows how long until there is a negligible amount left in a user's system, and how long the have 'In the Zone' (a period in which they feel the 'caffeine high').

## Build Details
First working build, with a few things on top of that.


Needs: UI update, better calculator, caffeine needs to slowly enter system until 45 mins (then it should start dropping), more items, subcategories, and better database integration.
